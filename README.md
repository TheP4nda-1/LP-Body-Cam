# LP-Body-Cam

This script creates a simple user interface designed to resemble a body camera, displaying the current date and time. Every full minute, a sound is played to confirm that the body camera is still active.

## Features:
- Date and Time Display: Shows the current date and time in a styled area that mimics a body camera display.

- Sound Alert: Plays a sound every full minute to indicate that the body camera is still active. The sound is defined by an MP3 file.

- BodyCam Control: You can open and close the body camera using the /BodyCam command.

Make sure to replace the placeholder for the MP3 file with the actual file you want to use, and ensure that the browser allows audio playback for the sound to be heard.
